Put your reflections and notes for the future here!

Reflections:
I will need to put some of the final things to make this into what I really want it to be, a fun game of Gobblet. 
- Gobbling
- Rules with logic
- Saving

After finishing:
I implemented gobbling, rules, and exceptions. These took some time but I got it to a state that I was happy with to call finished. The one thing I missed from the official rules was a draw condition. If I decide to continue working on this project, maybe for practice with GUIs, I will 100 percent add drawing. I also probably would want a quit option in the menu to end the game. 

Notes:

I may not actually end up doing Saving because Exceptions make my program flow better anyway. Saving would be a want to have and I might not have time for it. 

I ended up just not doing File I/O because it seemed like an unneccesary feature that was just to say I did it. I may end up implementing that in my own time. 

All the exceptions found are intended, unless they do not have a message or they completely stop the program.
