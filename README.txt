This project was for a computer science course taken in Fall 2023. For the project, the criteria were to utilize topics introduced in the course. The topics to be utilized were as follows:
Procedural programming in Java
	-Variables of varying types
	-Console input and output
	-If statements
	-Loops
	-Static Methods
	-Arrays*
Java Standard library (At least one from the following list utility)
	-ArrayList (Resizing array)
	-Math (Math utilities)
	-Random (Generate random numbers)
	-String (Text)
	-etc (Something not included here?)
Object-oriented programming
	-Defining your own classes (At least two classes in their own files)
	-Creating objects
	-Inheritance*
		-Abstract classes
		-Polymorphism
-Exception Handling*
-File input and Output* (Read and/or save data from your program)

*Atleast half marked with "*" must be utilized. 



From Project Report Abstract:

With Gobblet, the idea is to incorporate many fundamental
programming concepts in Java in a way that was fun to build and
use afterwards. This includes topics such as procedural
programming, standard libraries, and object-oriented
programming.

In order to do this, Gobblet will consist of a 2 player game of
the board game Gobblet all within a console. Each player will
take their turn placing a piece on the board and the first to
connect 4 in a row/column/diagonal wins; similar to tic-tac-toe.
However, each piece has its own size and can overtake a spot on
the board if the already placed piece is smaller; this covers
the piece but does not remove it, thus if the larger piece is
moved later, the piece under will be revealed. Pieces can also
be repositioned after being placed since there will not be
enough pieces to fill the board.

To convey the game state, ascii art will be made to represent
the board and the pieces on the board as well as the pieces left
in each playerâ€™s hand with each player represented by a
different color (red or blue).
